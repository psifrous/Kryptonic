 <li>
A digital cryptocurrency investment webApp which will help you decide in which coin to invest based on its history and trends, using machine learning on it.</li>
 <li> When the user enters the coin he wants to invest in and the time for which he/she wants to invest, we train a personalized Prophet model on our Microsoft Azure machine and predict net profit in the form of <b>Kryptons</b>:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:!! We can also compare multiple coins and show the best one to invest in. Everthing happens realtime in just a matter of some seconds!!!‚è±Ô∏è</li>
<li><b>Kryptons</b>:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:: It is statistical value developed by our team which tells us the confidence of investment, Higher the number of Kryptons, Higher is your chance of a good investment!</li>
